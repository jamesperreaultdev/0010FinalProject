# 0010FinalProject


## Introduction 
In this project our group was tasked with analyzing WPRDC datasets to figure out the best burrow in Pittsburgh. In order to do this we needed to generate a metric that we believed could classify a neighborhood as the "best". Each group member could then work on complementary datasets to create this metric. To come up with this important statistic we met as a group and identified some attributes we loved about the places we live. At first we thought of characteristics like a solid education system, gothic architecture, and large voting participation from the populous in local elections. However, we soon came to a consensus and realized there a few neighborhood qualities that mean way more to us. Among these were parks and natural beauty, a safe and well protected community, and minimal taxation.
